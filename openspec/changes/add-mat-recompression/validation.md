# Implementation validation — 2026-10-04

## Implemented and tested

Level-5 existing compressed envelopes and separately detected v7.3 HDF5 paths are implemented behind experimental_formats. Passive framing and exact payload/graph preservation, SciPy secondary read-back and synthetic v7.3 tests pass.

Integration includes CLI/bulk/library validation, unchanged reasons and JSON profile details,
shared ordinary-file candidate/source/destination transactions, isolated native workers,
cumulative decode/node/scratch/time accounting, sampled RSS supervision and cancellation.
Scientific dry-run does not encode or create candidate workspaces.

## Evidence

- [Full reproducible report and all-attempt artifacts](../../../dev/format_survey/implementation-2026-10-04/README.md).
- [Runtime profile contracts](../../../docs/docs/formats/scientific.md).
- [Trusted native and adversarial tests](../../../test/test_scientific_formats.py).

The earlier full suite passed (1,373 tests, 145 skips); the final focused integration suite passed 423 tests with 4 skips.
This includes 84 scientific tests with one filesystem-dependent skip, root-accounting closure after worker failure and preservation of prior destinations on scientific refusal.
Full repository Ruff/mypy, Python 3.9 module compilation, seven strict OpenSpec validations and the documentation production build pass.
Native CI is configured but its remote runs are not claimed as completed.

## Open qualification gates

Native MATLAB is unavailable. The two original complete MAT inputs had no benefit. Additional real origins, native MATLAB dialect checks and their reader floors remain mandatory release gates; this change is not release-complete.

This validation note records actual work without declaring every broader task in
`tasks.md` complete. No change is archived or represented as universally qualified.

## Current integrated reconciliation — 2026-10-07

The [completion audit](../../../dev/quality/completion-2026-10-07.md) records
current runtime/installation checks, qualification scope and open gates.
`tasks.md` now distinguishes implemented tasks from unmet whole-corpus,
historical/native reader and platform requirements. The dated evidence above
is retained as its original experiment record; no release/deployment is asserted.
